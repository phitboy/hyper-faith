## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. OmamoriNFT.sol - HIGHEST RISK CONTRACT ✅

**Risk Level**: LOW (Well-secured main contract)

#### ✅ SECURE: Reentrancy Protection
- **Analysis**: Dual burn mode with external calls to HYPE token and native transfers
- **Finding**: **NO REENTRANCY RISK** - Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern
- **Evidence**: 
  - State changes (`_tokenIdCounter++`, `tokenData[tokenId]`) occur before external calls
  - `_safeMint()` called after all external interactions
  - No state dependencies on external call results

#### ✅ SECURE: Access Control
- **Analysis**: Owner-only functions with OpenZeppelin `Ownable`
- **Finding**: **PROPER ACCESS CONTROL** - No privilege escalation risks
- **Functions Reviewed**:
  - `setBurnMode()` - Owner only ✅
  - `setHypeToken()` - Owner only ✅  
  - `setRenderer()` - Owner only ✅
  - `setMaterials()` - Owner only ✅
  - `emergencyWithdraw()` - Owner only ✅
  - `recoverERC20()` - Owner only ✅

#### ✅ SECURE: Randomness Generation
- **Analysis**: Material and punch count randomness using `block.prevrandao`
- **Finding**: **SECURE ENTROPY** - Sufficient for NFT use case
- **Implementation**:
  ```solidity
  uint64 seed = uint64(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
      block.prevrandao,  // ✅ Post-merge secure randomness
      msg.sender,        // ✅ User-specific
      tokenId,           // ✅ Unique per mint
      block.timestamp    // ✅ Time-based variation
  ))));
  ```

#### ⚠️ MEDIUM: Flash Loan Resistance
- **Analysis**: Dual burn mode could theoretically be exploited with flash loans
- **Finding**: **LOW IMPACT** - No economic incentive for manipulation
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Material randomness doesn't affect token value significantly
  - HYPE burn requirement creates cost barrier
  - No arbitrage opportunities identified
- **Recommendation**: Monitor for unusual minting patterns post-launch

#### ⚠️ MEDIUM: Native HYPE Refund Logic
- **Analysis**: Refund mechanism in native mode uses low-level call
- **Finding**: **POTENTIAL GAS GRIEFING** - Refund could fail with malicious contracts
- **Code**: 
  ```solidity
  (bool refundSuccess, ) = msg.sender.call{value: msg.value - amountToBurn}("");
  require(refundSuccess, "OmamoriNFT: Refund failed");
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Consider pull-over-push pattern for refunds or gas limit

### 2. OmamoriRender.sol - MEDIUM RISK CONTRACT ✅

**Risk Level**: LOW (Secure rendering with minor considerations)

#### ✅ SECURE: SVG Injection Prevention
- **Analysis**: On-chain SVG generation with user inputs
- **Finding**: **NO INJECTION RISK** - All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Evidence**:
  - Material colors from trusted registry (hex strings)
  - Glyph IDs validated at mint time (`majorId < 12`, `minorId < 4`)
  - No user-controlled string concatenation in SVG

#### ✅ SECURE: Gas DoS Protection
- **Analysis**: Complex SVG rendering could cause gas exhaustion
- **Finding**: **OPTIMIZED GAS USAGE** - Efficient rendering algorithms
- **Gas Report**: `tokenURIView` avg: 1,252,539 gas (well within limits)

#### ℹ️ INFO: View Function Security
- **Analysis**: `tokenURIView` is view function with external calls
- **Finding**: **SAFE PATTERN** - Read-only calls to trusted contracts
- **Note**: Materials registry is immutable, no manipulation risk

### 3. MaterialRegistryPalette.sol - MEDIUM RISK CONTRACT ✅

**Risk Level**: LOW (Secure weight distribution)

#### ✅ SECURE: Weight Distribution Integrity
- **Analysis**: 1B weight system across 24 materials
- **Finding**: **MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT** - Weights sum to exactly 1,000,000,000
- **Test Evidence**: `test_WeightSum()` and `test_MaterialDistribution()` pass
- **Gas Report**: `weight()` avg: 2,505 gas (highly optimized)

#### ✅ SECURE: Deterministic Behavior
- **Analysis**: Material selection must be fair and consistent
- **Finding**: **DETERMINISTIC AND FAIR** - Proper cumulative weight algorithm
- **Implementation**: Standard weighted random selection with fallback

### 4. Library Contracts - LOW RISK ✅

**Risk Level**: VERY LOW (Pure functions, deterministic)

#### ✅ SECURE: OmamoriGlyphs.sol
- **Analysis**: 12 Major + 48 Minor glyph rendering
- **Finding**: **SECURE SVG GENERATION** - No text/emoji, only geometric shapes
- **Gas Report**: Efficient rendering, no DoS risk

#### ✅ SECURE: PunchLayout.sol  
- **Analysis**: 25-slot diamond layout with collision detection
- **Finding**: **DETERMINISTIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE** - Proper AABB overlap detection
- **Test Coverage**: 12 comprehensive tests including collision scenarios

## Budget Considerations

### Factors Affecting Cost:
- **Contract Complexity**: Medium (NFT + custom burning)
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,000 (moderate size)
- **Test Coverage**: Excellent (reduces audit time)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive (reduces audit time)
- **Timeline**: Flexible vs urgent

### Cost Optimization Tips:
1. **Good Documentation** = Lower costs (already done ‚úÖ)
2. **Comprehensive Tests** = Faster audit (already done ‚úÖ)
3. **Clean Code** = Fewer issues to fix (already done ‚úÖ)
4. **Flexible Timeline** = Better rates
5. **Multiple Quotes** = Competitive pricing

## 🏆 Key Learnings & Solutions

### HyperEVM Specific Challenges Solved
1. **Block Gas Limit**: 2M gas limit required contract optimization
2. **HYPE Bridge**: Native gas requires bridging from HyperCore
3. **Deployment Strategy**: Post-deployment initialization pattern works perfectly
4. **Network Configuration**: Chain ID 999, native HYPE for gas

### Security Best Practices Implemented
1. **Owner-only Initialization**: Secure material setup process
2. **Weight Validation**: Exact 1B total weight verification
3. **Finalization Lock**: Prevents post-initialization changes
4. **Access Control**: Proper owner permissions throughout
